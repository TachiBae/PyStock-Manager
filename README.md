# Tech Inventory System (Python + MySQL)

A simple and efficient desktop-based inventory management system. This application allows users to add, edit, delete, and generate reports for technology products. It uses Python for the logic and a MySQL database (via XAMPP) for persistent data storage.

This was developed as a final project for the Design and Implementation of Programming Languages (6DIPROGLANG) course.



## Features

- **Add Records:** Insert new products with their ID, name, quantity, and price.  
- **Edit Records:** Update existing product quantities or mark items as spoiled/damaged.  
- **Delete Records:** Remove products from the database completely.  
- **Inventory Report:** Automatically calculates total inventory value, counts spoiled items, and flags items that need restocking (quantity under 10).  
- **Automatic Database Setup:** The script automatically creates the required database tables on its first run.  



## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**  
- **XAMPP** (for the local MySQL server)  
- **MySQL Connector for Python**
